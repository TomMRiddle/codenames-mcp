- Focus on critical game flow scenarios
- Emphasize edge cases in game rules

**Black Box Testing**:
- Test functionality against requirements
- Validate MCP protocol compliance
- Test user scenarios end-to-end

**White Box Testing**:
- Unit test internal game logic
- Test error handling paths
- Validate state transitions
